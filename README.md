# MECH-105-Algorithms
These are algorithms that I created within Matlab in a Mechanical Engineering Problem Solving course at CSU during my sophomore year as a Biomedical and Mechnical Engineering student.
The production of these algorithms started with learning how to solve each method by hand, planning each code on paper first, and then implimenting the skills and built in functions related to Matlab in order to create a final product. There were many trials and errors that affected the overall development of these algorithms.
I hope to be able to use these functions in more advanced courses during my time at CSU, in addition to internships, jobs, etc. after college.
